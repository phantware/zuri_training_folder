'''
This data type supports only numerical values like 1, 31.4, -1000, 0.000023, 88888888.

Python supports 3 different numerical types.

int - for integer values like 1, 100, 2255, -999999, 0, 12345678.
float - for floating-point values like 2.3, 3.14, 2.71, -11.0.
complex - for complex numbers like 3+2j, -2+2.3j, 10j, 4.5+3.14j.

# Complex number
# As you may know complex number consists of two parts real and imaginary, and is denoted by j. You can define complex number like this:

x = 2 + 3j # where 2 is the real part and 3 is imaginary

# Float Division (/) : The /  operator divides and return result as floating point number means it will always return fractional part. For e.g

a = 3/2 # 1.5

# Integer Division (//) : The // perform integer division i.e it will truncate the decimal part of the answer and return only integer.

b = 3//2 # 1

# Exponentiation Operator (**) : This operator helps to compute ab (a raise to the power of b). Let's take an example:

c = 2 ** 3 # is same as 2 * 2 * 2 = 8

# Remainder operator (%) : The % operator also known as remainder or modulus operator. This operator return remainder after division. For e.g:

d = 7 % 2 # 1
