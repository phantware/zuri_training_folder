# Use for loop through the list from 1 to 21
# Use Modulus to check that the result is NOT  EQUAL to 0
# Print the odds

# Solution

# for i in range(1,21):
#  if((i % 2) != 0):
#   print("i = ", i)

# Write a program that takes in a float number
# Round the float number to 2 decimal places
# Print out the result

# Solution

your_numb = input("Enter a float: ")
your_numb = float(your_numb)
print("Round to 2 decimal : {:.2f}".format(your_numb))
